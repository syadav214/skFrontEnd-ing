                Fortis Healthcare is struggling with cash strapping, by why? Founders' financial irregularities put company  under radar of SEBI and SFIO. Investors are in fear. Some of them knew earlier and walked away from the company. But, many of them lost money or going to lose. 
<br/><br/>

226.8 was the share price of Fortis on 2nd May 2017. Around same time, Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh (founders of Fortis) took 500 crores from the company without board approval. We cannot deny the hand of CAs and auditors of the company. Huge transaction cannot be done without taking them into confidence. 
CAs should be accountable and responsible with founders. We must say that corporate corruption is on the rise.
<br/><br/>

Since highest price in May 2017, stock began to decline and reached the level of 114.2 on 6th Feb 2018. It clearly suggested that there were people who were scared and not buying due financial statements of the company. In same month, ICAI came into picture to investigate irregularities. 
<br/><br/>

ICAI took much of time to investigate and now we have experienced a failed board meeting on 19th April 2018. They decided to meet again on 26th April 2018. Till 28th April 2018 trading window will be closed. What are all these chirping is going on? They should be put behind the bars.
<br/><br/>

SEBI and ICAI failed to take major action against these kinds of financial irregularities or frauds.
