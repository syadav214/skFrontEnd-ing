                Is Punjab National Bank trustworthy still, after share price dropped from 194 to 98, nearly a drop of 100 at stock markets. It may have been a time when price dropped with significant amount. Well, not all that we are talking here. PNB has been one of better PSU banks in our country. Government, RBI and Board Members of the bank are not the back foot, because of a scam. 
                <br/><br/>
The scam was manufactured by bribing and greediness of rich people to become more rich.
Nirav Modi the main accused of LOU scam at Brady House branch of Punjab National Bank, had played smartly and made friendship with a deputy manager of the branch. He flown away from the country and left Indian public to cry for hard earned money. There can be many accused from senior politician to senior bank officials, RBI people and Auditors.
<br/><br/>
But, what about public’s money in share market. There are a lot of people who have invested in PNB. All of them get looted at stock market. They become helpless twice. If we look at PNB share deviation from last 5 years. We can find pattern in it, such as share price was below 100 in every 2-3 years. They started their bull run from 85 (Aug 2013) to 224 (Dec 2014); which their highest price. If Auditors and RBI had verified Bank’s wrongdoing at time, the price could have not shoot up to 224. 
<br/><br/>
Future of PNB looks gloomy. There are possibility that big PSU bank like SBI can overtake or RBI can merge with other PSU bank. We would advise not to invest in PNB on the account of transparency within the organization. Investors need a clear and accountable system in PNB, so that It can be trustworthy. And our Machine Learning model suggested that It is not right to invest.
