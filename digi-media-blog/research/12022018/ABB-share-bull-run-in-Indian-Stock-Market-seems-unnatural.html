                Sometimes, It is not straight forward to find valid and supporting reason for a company's growth; not in case of ABB India. We saw a good bull of ABB India Stock along with Indian Share Market's commendable performance since last year. Isn't it all that matters to analyze? 
                <br/>
                Answer is NO.
                <br/><br/>
Same month and a year ago, ABB the Swiss Engineering Company got hit by a financial fraud by their own employee. The fraud was done by reportedly South Korean Subsidiary's employee, a Korean national. It may be easy for the employee, but it was so hard to accept that a company with high standards of administration and management ability could fail to detect a dark hole within the organization.
<br/><br/>
What have been the reason for their negligence towards a financial wrongdoing. You can see a lack of accountability and responsibility of Management to detect a huge loophole in the system, forget about reputation of being a Swiss company.
<br/><br/>
It was not the only thing was happening from Switzerland to Korea. If you stop in between your journey and land in India. You would see uncharacteristic rise in market capitalisation and share price of ABB India. The share grew too much. We believe that it is not natural to grow if you have a negativity within the core of management.
<br/><br/>
It would not take much of time for ABB India to reach it's real share price in coming months. 
<br/>
And we say, "it's going south."
