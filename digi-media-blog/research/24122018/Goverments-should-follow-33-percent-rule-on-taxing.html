                 What is the Laffer Curve? We are going to talk about that. A major American economist, Arthur Laffer has conceptuized it.
                <br/>The Laffer Curve states the two most important things about taxes: 
                <br/>how much money the government can raise from taxes and
                <br/>
                at what level of taxation the government might start getting less, not more, revenue.
                <br/><br/>
                 First, because zero times any number == 0, if the tax rate is 0, the government receives zero revenue i.e. [0,0] on a graph.
                <br/>Now suppose the government chooses a very small tax rate, say 1 percent.
                <br/> The government will then begin to receive some revenue
                from citizens. This means that another point on the curve must be something like this [1,1]. 
                <br/><br/>Now suppose the government charges
                a 2 percent tax rate, then, everyone would agree,that it will receive even more revenue; which means that another point on
                the curve must be something like [2,2]. 
                <br/>And if the government keeps raising the rate, then revenue will continue to go up.
                at least when we're in the low-tax-rate part of the graph.
                <br/> This means that if we fill in the curve, it has an upward slope
                at least when we're in the low-tax-rate-part of the graph.
                <br/><br/>
                 Now suppose the government charges a 100% tax rate. If this happens, then no one would work. Why would anyone work when
                the government is going to take all the money that they make? And if no one works, then the national income will be zero.
                <br/>This means that government revenue will be 100% of zero, or zero and that is another point on the curve must be at [100,0].
                <br/><br/>
                 Now if we complete the curve. And when we do, we see that the curve must have a hump. That is, it could look like this,
                or this, or this. But it has to have a hump. This is simply because the revenue line has to go up in the low tax rate part
                of the graph and has to start going down to reach the point we drew at the 100 percent tax rate.
                <br/><br/>
                 New evidence from an unexpected source suggests that the hump occurs at a much lower tax rate, something around 33 percent.
                That source is a study by Christina Romer and her husband David Romer. Both are economics professors at University of California
                Berkeley.
                <br/><br/>
                 This study examined how national income responds to tax rates. But as far as what concerns us here, the key point is that,
                if you do the math, the results imply that the hump on the Laffer Curve occurs where the tax rate is around 33 percent.
