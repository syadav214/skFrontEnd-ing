                Lookout notices has been issued against 6 ex-IL&FS officers. You must be wondering why?
<br/>Not only we have corrupt politicians and businessmen, but also we have company officers who have fraudster mind.
<br/>India is becoming a country for frauds and more frauds.
<br/><br/>

IL&FS is a finance company to provide finance and loans to infrastructre projects. 
<br/>Everything was going good the company, but they blocked somewhere due to not having enough cash.
<br/>They took loans to give loans and unfortunelty, they did not get it from their debtors. Bang Bang! money is lost who can find it.
<br/><br/>
IL&FS has many subsidiries who mainly work with infrastructre projects.
<br/>You must be believing all small guy can lift the big guy.
You are wrong. It all started from the bottom down. They foundation is not strong and you try to build infrastructre on it. It will not stand.
<br/><br/>
IL&FS asking SBI, LIC to bail them out from this crisis. SBI and LIC the goverment owned companies have invested 
heavily in the company.
<br/>We believe they will bailout IL&FS. They would want to get money from debtors and sell the assest to square off the situation.
<br/>ICAI are the insitution to whom no one asks the question. Their auditors must be blidly signing the balance sheet.
<br/><br/>
Serious Fraud Investigation Office is trying to hunt culprits of debt burden of 91,000 crore INR.
