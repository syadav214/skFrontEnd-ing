                Indians merely talk about not buying chinese product; which are taking money  away from India to China. We are overlooking Hollywood movies; specifically Marvel movies. They are taking most of money generated from entertainment to USA. Don’t we fix it? We are going to talk about that.
<br/><br/>
90’s kids and new millennium kids read comics and watched animated cartoons of Marvels and DC. Hollywood was prepared to cash on it. They created more superficial characters as superheroes. USA and western world was in awe of Marvel movies. Makers of the movies diverted their focus on India’s growing economy and cash rich middle class community which was larger than USA’ population. 
<br/><br/>
They understood how bollywood (Mumbai based Hindi film industry) and other regional cinema works. They figured out schedule of big Indian movies and planned their releases according to it.
They got famous Indian actors to dub in Hindi / Tamil/ Telugu and Bhojpuri. They created a nice and fruitful plan to  succeed in India. And we were and are ready to give our money to USA for free. Apart from hollywood’ strategy, most of Indian movies have not sense of film making and entertainment and they have a stupid story, scenes and acting.
<br/><br/>
Let us provide you few recents figures of hollywood in India:
<ul>
<li>Black Panther grossed more than INR 50 crore in India, having earned INR 13.75 crore in the first weekend of release. </li>
<li>Avengers: Infinity War passed more than INR 200 crore by the end of its fourth weekend. </li>
<li>Deadpool 2 received a great opening in India with the film recording INR 11.25 crore on the first day. 
<br/>Deadpool 2 gathered Rs 33.40 crore in first 3 days. </li>
</ul>
<br/>
We could have used those crores of money for better education and infrastructure.
